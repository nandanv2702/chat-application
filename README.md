# Chat Application
I'm creating a chat application using NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB (coming soon). This is a project for me to experiment with Socket.io and learn how to integrate OAuth 2.0 in a real-world-like application. This'll be hosted on Heroku/Netlify and you'll be able to DM people, create your own room and chat with others. 

This app also implements a new design trend called 'neumorphism' which is a minimal way to design with a soft, extruded plastic look.
